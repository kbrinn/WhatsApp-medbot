# Recommended Improvements

This document lists areas where the current WhatsApp MedBot codebase could be enhanced before deploying it to production.

## Testing and CI
- Add a `requirements-dev` file or Poetry extras so development tools like `flake8`, `pytest`, and `black` are installed consistently.
- Set up a continuous integration workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run unit tests and linting on every pull request.
- Increase unit test coverage, especially around the LangChain agents and Facebook API integration.

## Application Configuration
- Replace plain environment variables with a configuration class and validations for required keys.
- Consider using secrets management (e.g., Docker secrets or a cloud secret store) for API keys and database credentials.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Standardize error responses from the FastAPI endpoints.
- Add more granular logging around external API calls and database operations.

## Database Layer
- Use SQLAlchemy models for all tables and employ Alembic for migrations.
- Implement transaction retries or rollbacks on failures.

## Security
- Perform a security review to ensure PHI is never logged or persisted insecurely.
- Enable HTTPS in deployment environments and enforce OAuth for admin endpoints.

## Documentation
- Document the local development workflow including how to run linting and tests.
- Add an architecture diagram showing data flow between components.
